Picture1 : Installing the required tools(ROS2,microROS)

Picture2 : The Husky vehicle modeled by Clearpath. All engine and sensor data defined in .urdf format.

Picture3 : We've added 'sjtu_drone', in .urdf format and with plugins, to the simulation environment.

Picture4 : A basic landing and take-off algorithm that will work together with the drone and UGV.

Picture5 and Picture6 : Using the scripts we developed, image processing is applied to the camera feed, and with this 
algorithm combined with GPS and IMU data, the drone performs a precise and accurate landing on the UGV.
